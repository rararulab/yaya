# Plugin Protocol (v0 → 1.0)

yaya's kernel is deliberately small: an event bus, a plugin registry,
and a fixed agent loop. **Everything else is a plugin** — every user
surface, every LLM provider, every tool, every skill, every memory
backend, every next-action strategy. This document is the authoritative
contract.

- **v0** is the 0.1 shape we ship with. Shapes may evolve in 0.x.
- **1.0** freezes: event kinds, payload schemas, the registration ABI,
  the strategy interface, the adapter contract, and the web↔kernel WS
  schema. Plugins written against 1.0 keep working across 1.x.

## Plugin categories (closed set)

| Category | Role | Subscribes to | Emits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `adapter` | User surface (web, TUI, Telegram, …). Translates external I/O to kernel events and renders outgoing events. | `assistant.message.*`, `tool.call.start`, `plugin.*`, `kernel.*` | `user.message.received`, `user.interrupt` |
| `tool` | Executes a discrete action (run shell, read file, HTTP). | `tool.call.request` (filtered by tool name) | `tool.call.result` |
| `llm-provider` | Speaks to one LLM vendor (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, …). | `llm.call.request` (filtered by provider id) | `llm.call.response`, `llm.call.error` |
| `strategy` | Decides the agent loop's next step. | `strategy.decide.request` | `strategy.decide.response` |
| `memory` | Stores and retrieves conversational state. | `memory.query`, `memory.write` | `memory.result` |
| `skill` | Domain-specific behavior built on top of the other categories. Subscribes to user messages (filtered) and orchestrates via kernel events. | `user.message.received` (filtered) | any public event via the kernel |

A plugin declares exactly one category. Multi-category plugins ship as
multiple packages.

## Event taxonomy (v0 — frozen at 1.0)

All events carry a common envelope:

```python
class Event(TypedDict):
    id: str              # uuid, kernel-assigned on publish
    kind: str            # dotted identifier — see catalog below
    session_id: str      # conversation scope; plugin-private events pick any stable id
    ts: float            # kernel-assigned unix epoch seconds
    source: str          # plugin name that emitted it (or "kernel")
    payload: dict        # kind-specific; shapes below
```

### Public event kinds (closed)

#### User input (adapter → kernel)

| kind | payload |
|---|---|
| `user.message.received` | `{ text: str, attachments?: list[Attachment] }` |
| `user.interrupt` | `{}` (ends the current turn) |

#### Assistant output (kernel → adapters)

| kind | payload |
|---|---|
| `assistant.message.delta` | `{ content: str }` (streaming chunk) |
| `assistant.message.done` | `{ content: str, tool_calls: list[ToolCall] }` |

#### LLM invocation (kernel ↔ llm-provider)

| kind | direction | payload |
|---|---|---|
| `llm.call.request` | kernel → provider | `{ provider: str, model: str, messages: list[Message], tools?: list[ToolSchema], params: dict }` |
| `llm.call.delta` | provider → kernel | `{ content?: str, tool_call_partial?: dict, request_id?: str }` |
| `llm.call.response` | provider → kernel | `{ text?: str, tool_calls?: list[ToolCall], usage: Usage, request_id?: str }` |
| `llm.call.error` | provider → kernel | `{ error: str, kind?: "connection"\|"timeout"\|"status"\|"empty"\|"other", status_code?: int, retry_after_s?: float, request_id?: str }` |

#### Tool execution (kernel ↔ tool)

| kind | direction | payload |
|---|---|---|
| `tool.call.request` | kernel → tool | `{ id: str, name: str, args: dict, schema_version?: "v1", request_id?: str }` |
| `tool.call.start` | kernel → adapters (for UI) | `{ id: str, name: str, args: dict }` |
| `tool.call.result` | tool → kernel | `{ id: str, ok: bool, value?: Any, error?: str, envelope?: dict, request_id?: str }` |
| `tool.error` | kernel → originator | `{ id: str, kind: "validation" \| "not_found" \| "rejected", brief: str, detail?: dict, request_id?: str }` |

#### Approval (kernel ↔ adapter)

| kind | direction | payload |
|---|---|---|
| `approval.request` | kernel → adapter | `{ id: str, tool_name: str, params: dict, brief: str }` |
| `approval.response` | adapter → kernel | `{ id: str, response: "approve" \| "approve_for_session" \| "reject", feedback?: str }` |
| `approval.cancelled` | kernel → adapter | `{ id: str, reason: "timeout" \| "shutdown" }` |

All three envelopes route on the reserved `"kernel"` session id — NOT
the originating tool call's session. See **Approval flow** below for
the deadlock rationale (lesson #2).

#### Memory (kernel ↔ memory)

| kind | direction | payload |
|---|---|---|
| `memory.query` | kernel → memory | `{ query: str, k: int }` |
| `memory.write` | kernel → memory | `{ entry: MemoryEntry }` |
| `memory.result` | memory → kernel | `{ hits: list[MemoryEntry], request_id?: str }` |

#### Strategy (kernel ↔ strategy)

| kind | direction | payload |
|---|---|---|
| `strategy.decide.request` | kernel → strategy | `{ state: AgentLoopState }` |
| `strategy.decide.response` | strategy → kernel | `{ next: "llm" \| "tool" \| "memory" \| "done", request_id?: str, ... }` |

#### Plugin lifecycle (kernel → all)

| kind | payload |
|---|---|
| `plugin.loaded` | `{ name: str, version: str, category: str }` |
| `plugin.reloaded` | `{ name: str, version: str }` |
| `plugin.removed` | `{ name: str }` |
| `plugin.error` | `{ name: str, error: str }` |

#### Kernel (kernel → all)

| kind | payload |
|---|---|
| `kernel.ready` | `{ version: str }` |
| `kernel.shutdown` | `{ reason: str }` |
| `kernel.error` | `{ source: str, message: str, detail?: dict }` |

#### Session lifecycle (kernel → all)

| kind | payload |
|---|---|
| `session.started` | `{ session_id: str, tape_name: str, workspace: str }` |
| `session.handoff` | `{ session_id: str, name: str, state: dict }` |
| `session.reset` | `{ session_id: str, archive_path: str \| null }` |
| `session.archived` | `{ session_id: str, archive_path: str }` |
| `session.forked` | `{ parent_id: str, child_id: str }` |

### Extension namespace

Plugins may emit and subscribe to events named `x.<plugin>.<kind>`.
The kernel routes these through the same bus but **does not interpret
them and does not promise compatibility across versions**. Use this
namespace for plugin-private payloads (e.g., a `stats` skill plugin
emitting `x.stats.token.counted`). Do not use `x.*` as a workaround
for missing public events — propose a public event kind instead.

**Private session ids.** Plugins may use session ids prefixed with
`_bridge:<plugin-name>` for internal routing (publishing to themselves
without touching a user-facing session). This reserves `_bridge:` as a
plugin-private namespace; user / adapter sessions MUST NOT start with
`_bridge:`. Example: `mcp_bridge` routes lifecycle events on
`_bridge:mcp-bridge`.

Currently in use by bundled plugins:

| Extension kind | Owner | Payload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x.mcp.server.ready` | `mcp_bridge` | `{ server: str, tools: list[{name, mcp_name, description}] }` | One emit per MCP server the bridge brought up at boot. |
| `x.mcp.server.error` | `mcp_bridge` | `{ server: str, kind: "config_invalid" \| "boot_failed", message: str }` | One emit per MCP server that failed config validation or exhausted boot retries. The bridge keeps running. |

### What makes the set "closed"

- A PR that introduces a new **public** event kind (anything not under
  `x.<plugin>.<kind>`) is a **governance** change. It amends this
  document, `GOAL.md`'s plugin category table, and the Python
  `kernel/events.py` catalog in the same PR, and must carry the
  `governance` label.
- A PR that changes the **payload shape** of an existing public kind
  is a breaking change. Before 1.0, bump the minor version and note
  the migration. After 1.0, it requires a new kind (`foo.v2`) with
  both carried during a deprecation window.

## Plugin discovery and loading

Plugins are ordinary Python packages that expose a setuptools entry
point in the `yaya.plugins.v1` group:

```toml
# your-plugin's pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "yaya-tool-bash"
version = "0.1.0"

[project.entry-points."yaya.plugins.v1"]
bash = "yaya_tool_bash:plugin"
```

`yaya_tool_bash:plugin` resolves to a `Plugin` object (see ABI below).

The kernel discovers plugins in this order at boot:

1. **Bundled** — subpackages of `src/yaya/plugins/` declared in yaya's
   own `pyproject.toml` under the same entry-point group. Bundled
   plugins load through the **same protocol** as third-party plugins.
   No special cases.
2. **Installed** — any package in the active environment exposing a
   `yaya.plugins.v1` entry point (e.g., `pip install yaya-tool-bash`).
3. **Local overrides** — packages registered via `yaya plugin install
   <path>` (dev mode) in the user state directory.

`yaya plugin install <src>` accepts:
- A PyPI name: `yaya plugin install yaya-tool-bash` → shells to `pip install`.
- A local path: `yaya plugin install ./my-plugin` → editable install.
- A registry URL (2.0+): resolved through the future marketplace.

## Plugin ABI

Every plugin module exposes a `plugin` attribute conforming to this
interface:

```python
# pseudocode — authoritative Python lives in src/yaya/kernel/plugin.py

class Plugin(Protocol):
    name: str              # globally unique, kebab-case
    version: str           # semver
    category: Category     # one of the six categories above
    requires: list[str]    # other plugin names this depends on

    def subscriptions(self) -> list[str]:
        """Event kinds this plugin subscribes to.

        For `tool`, `llm-provider`, `strategy`, `memory`: the kernel
        filters by the category's default routing rules (see below).
        For `adapter` and `skill`: the plugin picks from the public
        event set; filtering by session_id is the plugin's job.
        """

    async def on_load(self, ctx: KernelContext) -> None:
        """Called once after registration, before any event delivery."""

    async def on_event(self, ev: Event, ctx: KernelContext) -> None:
        """Handle an event. Raise to surface a plugin.error."""

    async def on_unload(self, ctx: KernelContext) -> None:
        """Called on hot-reload or kernel shutdown. Must be idempotent."""
```

`KernelContext` gives the plugin an `emit(kind, payload, *,
session_id)` method, a scoped logger, access to its configuration,
and a state directory under `<XDG_DATA_HOME>/yaya/plugins/<name>/`.

### Tools (v1 contract)

Since 0.2, tools declare their contract through a pydantic-backed
`Tool` base class in `yaya.kernel.tool`. Plugins on this path do
**not** implement `on_event` to route `tool.call.request` themselves
— the kernel's dispatcher does it for them.

```python
from typing import ClassVar
from yaya.kernel import KernelContext
from yaya.kernel.tool import Tool, ToolOk, ToolReturnValue, TextBlock, register_tool

class EchoTool(Tool):
    name: ClassVar[str] = "echo"
    description: ClassVar[str] = "Echo the input text."
    text: str  # parameters are ordinary pydantic fields

    async def run(self, ctx: KernelContext) -> ToolReturnValue:
        return ToolOk(brief=f"echo: {self.text[:40]}", display=TextBlock(text=self.text))

# In the plugin's on_load:
async def on_load(self, ctx: KernelContext) -> None:
    register_tool(EchoTool)
```

**JSON schema** is derived by `Tool.openai_function_spec()` →
`{"name", "description", "parameters": model_json_schema()}`,
directly compatible with the OpenAI chat-completions `tools` array
shape. Anthropic's Messages API accepts the same dict under a
different key, so adapters repack without rewriting.

**Return envelope** — `ToolOk` / `ToolError` each carry:

- `brief: str` — one-liner (≤80 chars) for logs and status panes.
- `display: DisplayBlock` — adapter-rendering hint. Built-ins:
  `TextBlock(kind="text", text=...)`,
  `MarkdownBlock(kind="markdown", markdown=...)`,
  `JsonBlock(kind="json", data=...)`.

`ToolError` additionally carries `kind: str` — one of
`"validation" | "timeout" | "rejected" | "crashed" | "internal"`.
Additional kinds may be introduced additively.

**Dispatcher behaviour** — `yaya.kernel.tool.dispatch` handles a
`tool.call.request` event whose payload's `schema_version` equals
`"v1"`:

1. Looks the tool up by `payload.name` in the registry. Unknown name →
   `tool.error` with `kind="not_found"`.
2. Validates `payload.args` against the tool's pydantic schema.
   Failure → `tool.error` with `kind="validation"` and
   `detail.errors` carrying pydantic's structured error list.
   `run()` is **not** called.
3. If `requires_approval=True`, calls `pre_approve(ctx)`. A `False`
   return → `tool.error` with `kind="rejected"`.
4. Calls `run(ctx)`. A raised exception is coerced into
   `tool.call.result` with a `ToolError(kind="crashed")` envelope —
   the kernel never lets a tool exception escape onto the bus.
5. Emits `tool.call.result` with `{"id", "ok", "envelope":
   <model_dump>, "request_id"}`.

**Approval runtime** — see the **Approval flow** section below. A
`Tool` subclass with `requires_approval: ClassVar[bool] = True`
routes through the runtime automatically; the default `pre_approve`
awaits the user's answer via bus events. Subclasses MAY override
`approval_brief(self) -> str` (≤80 chars) to give the prompt a
clearer headline.

**Backward compatibility** — A `tool.call.request` payload without
`schema_version` falls through to whatever plugin subscribed via
`on_event`. Bundled plugins that pre-date v1 (e.g. `tool_bash`) keep
working unchanged. If a legacy plugin and a v1 registration claim the
same tool name, the registry logs a WARNING; duplicate
`tool.call.result` emissions are possible until one path is retired.

**The new `tool.error` event kind** is a kernel → originator event
emitted only by the v1 dispatcher (never by plugins). Adapters
typically render it inline with the originating assistant turn rather
than as a tool-pane update, because the target tool never ran.

### Approval flow

Tools that mutate state (shell, filesystem writes, network writes)
declare `requires_approval: ClassVar[bool] = True`. The kernel's
approval runtime (see `yaya.kernel.approval.ApprovalRuntime`) runs
between validation and `run()`:

```
tool.call.request (session=S)
  → dispatcher validates args, finds requires_approval=True
  → runtime.request(Approval(id=A, session_id=S, ...))
    → approval.request (session="kernel")          # bus-routing session
      → adapter renders prompt to user
      → user clicks approve / approve_for_session / reject
    ← approval.response (session="kernel", id=A)
  ← ApprovalResult(id=A, response=..., feedback=...)
  → dispatcher calls tool.run()   OR   emits tool.error(kind="rejected")
```

**Routing on `"kernel"` (lesson #2).** All three approval events
(`approval.request`, `approval.response`, `approval.cancelled`) MUST
carry `session_id="kernel"` on the envelope. The dispatcher runs
inside the originating tool-call session's drain worker; that worker
is blocked on `await pending_future` while the prompt is outstanding.
A response delivered on the **same** session would queue behind the
blocked handler and only drain after the 60s approval timeout —
effectively a deadlock. Routing the response on `"kernel"` resolves
the future from a different worker and lets the original session
worker wake up.

**`approve_for_session` cache.** When the user picks
`approve_for_session`, the runtime caches the tuple
`(tool_name, params_fingerprint)` under the originating session id
(carried inside the `Approval` model, NOT the envelope's routing
session). Subsequent identical calls on the same session skip the
prompt entirely — exactly one `approval.request` is emitted per
unique tuple. Cache is in-memory, never persisted, never
auto-evicted in 0.2 (process-bounded).

**Timeout.** If the adapter does not publish an `approval.response`
within 60s (configurable per `ApprovalRuntime`), the runtime:

1. Pops the pending future (no leak, lesson #6).
2. Emits `approval.cancelled` with `reason="timeout"`.
3. Raises `ApprovalCancelledError`; the dispatcher converts this to
   `tool.error` with `kind="rejected"` and a `brief` that carries
   the cancellation reason.

**Shutdown.** `PluginRegistry.stop` uninstalls the runtime before
`kernel.shutdown`. Pending futures observe
`ApprovalCancelledError(reason="shutdown")` so the loop tears down
cleanly instead of hanging on the per-request timeout.

**Adapter responsibilities.**

1. Subscribe to `approval.request` and render the prompt — display
   `tool_name`, `params` (sanitise!), and `brief`.
2. Offer three actions: approve / approve_for_session / reject. A
   reject MAY collect a free-text `feedback`.
3. Publish `approval.response` with the user's answer. Echo the
   request `id` verbatim. Publish on session `"kernel"`.
4. Subscribe to `approval.cancelled` to withdraw stale prompts.

When an LLM emits **parallel tool calls** that each gate through the
approval runtime, adapters MAY observe multiple `approval.request`
events for the same `(tool_name, params)` before the user has
answered the first prompt. Adapters SHOULD stack or group these in
the UI (one row per `(tool_name, params)` with a count badge), and
once the first answer arrives they SHOULD auto-respond to the
remaining matching requests with the same decision so the user only
clicks once. This is a UI affordance only — the kernel does NOT
deduplicate at the protocol level (the `approve_for_session` cache
short-circuits subsequent identical calls but only AFTER the first
prompt resolves), and proposals to add protocol-level dedup are out
of scope through 1.0 (would require a request-coalescing key that
adapters cannot author for arbitrary new tools).

### LLM providers (v1 contract)

Since 0.2, llm-provider plugins implement the streaming
`LLMProvider` Protocol in `yaya.kernel.llm`. Providers yield an
async iterator of content / tool-call parts and a terminal
`TokenUsage`; the kernel re-emits each stream chunk as an
`llm.call.delta` and the final state as `llm.call.response`.

**SDK-only rule (normative).** LLM-provider plugins MUST use the
official `openai` or `anthropic` Python SDK. Raw `httpx`, community
wrappers, LangChain-style frameworks, and any other LLM client
library are **rejected at review**. The two approved SDKs cover the
market we care about:

- `openai` (`AsyncOpenAI`) — OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and every
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint (DeepSeek, Moonshot, ollama, lm-studio,
  LiteLLM gateway) via `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `anthropic` (`AsyncAnthropic`) — Claude; native tool use, prompt
  caching, and streaming.

Anything else (Gemini, Bedrock, Vertex) is deferred. When we add
support, we still wrap the vendor's official SDK — never a raw HTTP
client. The rule is mechanically enforced by
`scripts/check_banned_frameworks.py` (the `check_llm_plugin_imports`
rule scans every `src/yaya/plugins/llm_*/**/*.py` for direct imports
of `httpx` / `requests` / `aiohttp` and fails CI on a hit). The
SDKs themselves use `httpx` internally; that is fine because the
plugin does not import it.

```python
from typing import Any, ClassVar
from yaya.kernel import Category, KernelContext
from yaya.kernel.llm import (
    APIConnectionError,
    ContentPart,
    LLMProvider,
    StreamedMessage,
    TokenUsage,
    openai_to_chat_provider_error,
)

class OpenAIProvider:
    name: str = "openai"
    model_name: str = "gpt-4o-mini"
    thinking_effort: str = "off"

    async def generate(
        self,
        *,
        system_prompt: str,
        tools: list[dict[str, Any]],
        history: list[dict[str, Any]],
    ) -> StreamedMessage:
        try:
            return await self._stream_with_sdk(system_prompt, tools, history)
        except Exception as exc:
            raise openai_to_chat_provider_error(exc) from exc
```

**Token usage** — `TokenUsage` carries four raw counters
(`input_other`, `input_cache_read`, `input_cache_creation`, `output`)
and two derived values (`input`, `total`). The split exists because
Anthropic bills prompt-cache hits and cache writes separately; for
providers without cache accounting the extras stay zero and `input`
collapses to `input_other`. `model_dump()` includes both the raw and
derived values so the bus payload carries everything a cost tracker
needs.

**Delta stream** — `StreamedMessage.__aiter__()` yields
`ContentPart | ToolCallPart` objects. The kernel re-publishes each
as `llm.call.delta` with either `content` (text chunk) or
`tool_call_partial` (provider-specific partial tool-call dict). After
iteration the kernel reads `StreamedMessage.usage` and publishes one
terminal `llm.call.response` with `text`, `tool_calls`, and `usage`
populated.

**Typed errors** — providers raise `ChatProviderError` subclasses at
the plugin boundary; SDK-specific exceptions are translated via the
converters shipped in `yaya.kernel.llm`:

- `openai_to_chat_provider_error(exc)` — maps `openai.APIConnectionError`,
  `openai.APITimeoutError`, and `openai.APIStatusError` to the
  matching yaya subclass.
- `anthropic_to_chat_provider_error(exc)` — same mapping for the
  `anthropic` SDK. Lazy-imports so a missing install doesn't break
  kernel boot.
- `convert_httpx_error(exc)` — catches raw `httpx` errors that leak
  through the SDK envelope during streaming (a kimi-cli precedent).

Unknown exception types degrade to a generic `ChatProviderError`
with `str(exc)`. `llm.call.error` payloads carry a `kind` field
(`"connection" | "timeout" | "status" | "empty" | "other"`) plus
optional `status_code` for status errors and `request_id` for
correlation.

**Retry hook (shape-only)** — providers that want loop-driven
retries implement `RetryableChatProvider.on_retryable_error(exc,
attempt) -> bool`. The Protocol is frozen in 0.2; the retry runtime
lands in a follow-up PR.

**Backward compatibility** — bundled `llm_openai` and `llm_echo`
predate v1 and remain on the legacy `on_event`-subscribes-to-
`llm.call.request` path. Migration to the v1 contract is a follow-up
PR for each provider — same discipline as `tool_bash` staying on the
legacy path in the Tool-contract PR.

### Category-specific extras

- **`tool`** declares `tool_name: str` and `json_schema: dict` for
  arguments. The kernel routes `tool.call.request` to the plugin whose
  `tool_name` matches. Since 0.2 the preferred path is to declare a
  `Tool` subclass and call `register_tool()` — see "Tools (v1
  contract)" above.
- **`llm-provider`** declares `provider_id: str` (e.g., `"openai"`).
  The kernel routes `llm.call.request` by `payload.provider`.
- **`strategy`** declares `strategy_id: str`. Only one strategy is
  active per session; `yaya serve --strategy <id>` (or a per-session
  setting) selects it. Default: `react`.
- **`memory`** declares whether it is a "short-term" or "long-term"
  store. Kernel may route queries differently based on session age.
- **`adapter`** declares `adapter_id: str`. An adapter may be
  short-lived (one WebSocket session per user) or long-lived (Telegram
  polling loop).

## Agent loop (kernel-owned)

The loop shape is fixed. Each turn runs this sequence:

```
user.message.received
  → strategy.decide.request  →  strategy.decide.response
    → memory.query           →  memory.result (if requested)
    → llm.call.request       →  llm.call.response
      → tool.call.request    →  tool.call.result   (repeat per tool)
    → assistant.message.done
  → memory.write (if requested by strategy)
```

Strategies control: which tools to offer, when to call memory, when to
stop. Strategies **do not** change the ordering of the sequence —
that is the kernel's contract with adapters.

### Correlation via event id

Request/response pairs (`strategy.decide.*`, `llm.call.*`,
`memory.query` / `memory.result`, `tool.call.request` /
`tool.call.result`) are correlated by the **originating event's `id`**:
when a plugin responds, it MUST mirror the request event's `id` back on
its response payload as `request_id`. The kernel's agent loop stamps a
fresh event id on each outbound request and awaits the response whose
`request_id` equals that id. This is how concurrent in-flight calls on
the same session are matched to the right awaiter without introducing a
separate correlation channel. `request_id` is an additive optional
field on the five response payloads above (`strategy.decide.response`,
`llm.call.response`, `llm.call.error`, `memory.result`,
`tool.call.result`) — compatible with hand-crafted test fixtures, but
required in practice for the kernel loop to observe a response.

## Plugin failure model

- A plugin raising from `on_event` produces `plugin.error` and the
  kernel continues. Each `plugin.error` attributed to a plugin
  increments its failure counter; a successful `on_event` invocation
  resets the counter to zero, so **N *consecutive* failures** — not N
  cumulative — triggers unload and emits `plugin.removed`. Default
  N = 3, configurable on the registry.
- A plugin hanging in `on_event` past a deadline (default 30s, per
  category) is cancelled; the same counter increments.
- `on_load` failure prevents registration; the plugin is marked
  `status: failed` in `yaya plugin list` with the stack trace in its
  state directory.
- Status ladder reported by `yaya plugin list` / `snapshot()`:
  `loaded → unloading → failed` for the threshold path (transient
  `unloading` between threshold breach and `on_unload` completion);
  `loaded → unloaded` for orderly `stop()` / `remove()`. `unloading`
  is observable so operators see in-flight unloads and so the registry
  can reject duplicate unload tasks from rival `plugin.error` events
  during the race window.
- **The kernel never crashes because a plugin did**. If the kernel
  itself raises, `kernel.error` fires, and `yaya serve` exits non-zero.

## Sessions and tape

A **session** is the kernel's canonical conversational state: an
append-only log of :class:`~republic.TapeEntry` values backed by a
:class:`~yaya.kernel.session.SessionStore`. Every bus event that
carries a "normal" ``session_id`` (i.e. not the reserved
``"kernel"`` session) is mirrored onto that session's tape by a
kernel subscriber; the LLM context is a derived view over the tape
(see :mod:`yaya.kernel.tape_context`), never a mutable history list
kept in memory.

### Persistence table

The bus auto-persister maps bus events onto tape entries:

| Bus event | Tape kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|

Plugins can opt an event out of persistence with a kernel-level
`persist=False` key on the payload (accepted as `"__persist__"` too
for extensions that want to keep the top-level payload clean).
Anything on session `"kernel"` is never persisted.

### Tape naming

Every tape is named `md5(workspace_abspath)[:16] + "__" +
md5(session_id)[:16]` so two sessions with the same `session_id` in
different workspaces live on different tapes. MD5 is a
collision-tolerant identifier — not a security primitive — hence
`hashlib.md5(..., usedforsecurity=False)`.

### Fork / compaction / reset

- **Fork** (`Session.fork(child_id)`): returns a child session backed
  by an overlay store. Reads see parent-entries + child-entries;
  writes land only on the child; `reset()` on the child does not
  touch the parent. Tooling for subagents.
- **Compaction**: append a summary anchor via `Session.handoff(name,
  state)` and run subsequent context queries with
  `after_last_anchor` (see :func:`yaya.kernel.tape_context.after_last_anchor`).
  Compaction never rewrites past entries — the summarised prefix
  stays on disk and is filtered out of the LLM context only.
- **Reset** (`Session.reset(archive=True)`): archives the current
  entries to `tapes/.archive/<tape>.jsonl.<stamp>.bak`, clears the
  tape, and re-seeds a `session/start` anchor. Safe for
  long-running conversations that have drifted off-topic.

### Auto-persister guarantees

- **Best-effort, not transactional.** A tape-write failure logs at
  WARNING and emits a `plugin.error` with `source="kernel-session-persister"`;
  the session keeps receiving events. Losing an observational entry
  is strictly better than halting the session worker.
- **No bus recursion.** The persister writes entries directly — it
  never re-publishes on the bus. Failure notifications use a
  non-`"kernel"` source so the bus recursion guard (lesson #2)
  still surfaces them through `plugin.error`.
- **Kernel session skipped.** Events emitted on session `"kernel"`
  (approval prompts, plugin lifecycle, kernel errors, etc.) do not
  land on any tape. Those events belong to the control plane; if
  an adapter needs to render them it subscribes to them directly.

## Security posture (1.0)

- Plugins run in-process as trusted code. There is no sandbox in 1.0.
- `yaya plugin install` surfaces a confirmation prompt showing the
  source (PyPI / path / URL) and declared category.
- The future sandbox (2.0) will restrict plugins by category-default
  capability sets (e.g., `tool` plugins get no network unless they
  declare it).

## What NOT To Do

- Do NOT add a special code path for bundled plugins. They must load,
  subscribe, and fail through the same protocol as third-party plugins.
- Do NOT emit public event kinds from plugin-private code paths. Use
  the `x.<plugin>.<kind>` namespace.
- Do NOT introduce a parallel event channel (e.g., a "fast path" for
  adapter events). The bus is the bus.
- Do NOT let plugins import from `src/yaya/cli/` or from each other
  directly. Cross-plugin communication happens through events.
- Do NOT break the agent loop's event ordering contract in a strategy
  plugin. Strategies decide *content*, not *order*.
