# Wiki Log

Append-only chronological record of ingests, queries, and lint
passes. Never rewrite history; append only. Entry prefix is
`## [YYYY-MM-DD] <kind> | <title>` so `grep "^## \[" log.md`
parses.

## [2026-04-17] ingest | Karpathy — LLM Wiki (gist 442a6bf)
Adopted the three-layer pattern (raw sources / wiki / schema) for
`docs/wiki/`. Added `AGENT.md`, `index.md`, this log, and
`sources/karpathy-llm-wiki.md`. Kept the existing
`lessons-learned.md` in place as the first `lessons/*` page.
See: sources/karpathy-llm-wiki.md, AGENT.md

## [2026-04-17] ingest | spec migration — .spec.md → .spec (issue #52)
Ported `kernel-bus-and-abi`, `kernel-agent-loop`, and `kernel-registry`
from Markdown-with-Gherkin `.spec.md` files to the canonical
agent-spec `.spec` format (YAML frontmatter + structured `Test:`
blocks with `Package:` + `Filter:`). `scripts/check_specs.sh` now
lints all four kernel specs in CI; previously it silently skipped
three. Added lesson #19 (author in tool format, not protocol-doc
pseudo-format). Prose examples in `AGENT.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `GOAL.md`, `docs/dev/architecture.md`,
`docs/dev/testing.md`, and package `AGENT.md` files updated from
`.spec.md` to `.spec`.

## [2026-04-17] ingest | BMAD-METHOD (bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)
Adopted two disciplines: the 4-phase gate model (analysis → plan →
solutioning → implementation, gated on explicit artifacts) and
explicit HALT conditions (no stopping at "milestones" or "natural
breakpoints"). Both codified in `docs/dev/workflow.md`. Rejected
the full installer, XML workflow DSL, sprint-status YAML tracker,
party mode, and the BMB/TEA/BMGD/CIS sibling modules — out of
scope for yaya. Retrospective ceremony merged into the existing
Karpathy wiki lint operation; no duplicate cadence.
See: sources/bmad-method.md, ../dev/workflow.md

## [2026-04-18] ingest | seed plugins (issue #14)
Landed the four non-adapter seed plugins — one per category — to
prove the plugin protocol end-to-end against the kernel registry
that shipped in PR #49. Each plugin is a bundled subpackage under
`src/yaya/plugins/<name>/` loaded through the same
`yaya.plugins.v1` entry-point ABI as third-party packages. `openai`
is the only LLM SDK accepted per AGENT.md §4; `tool_bash` uses
`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` exclusively (never `shell=True`);
`memory_sqlite` runs stdlib `sqlite3` through `asyncio.to_thread`;
`strategy_react` implements the observe-think-act decision. Every
response event echoes `request_id` per lesson #15. Each plugin
ships a BDD `.spec` (0 WARN from `agent-spec lint`) + unit tests
under `tests/plugins/<name>/`.
See: ../../specs/plugin-strategy_react.spec, ../../specs/plugin-memory_sqlite.spec, ../../specs/plugin-llm_openai.spec, ../../specs/plugin-tool_bash.spec, ../../src/yaya/plugins/
