"""Approval runtime — HITL gate for tool calls (#28).

Any :class:`~yaya.kernel.tool.Tool` subclass that sets
``requires_approval: ClassVar[bool] = True`` routes through this
runtime before its :meth:`~yaya.kernel.tool.Tool.run` body executes.
The runtime lives as a per-bus singleton wired up by
:func:`install_approval_runtime` at kernel boot; the dispatcher looks
it up via :func:`get_approval_runtime` and calls :meth:`ApprovalRuntime.request`
from inside the tool dispatch path.

Flow
----

1. Tool dispatcher detects ``requires_approval=True`` and calls
   ``pre_approve(ctx, session_id=...)``.
2. The default :meth:`~yaya.kernel.tool.Tool.pre_approve` builds an
   :class:`Approval`, hands it to the runtime, and awaits the user's
   response (or timeout).
3. The runtime emits ``approval.request`` on the bus. Adapters
   (web / TUI / tg) render the prompt.
4. The adapter's UI → adapter publishes ``approval.response`` with the
   matching ``id``. The runtime's subscriber resolves the pending
   future and returns the :class:`ApprovalResult`.

Session-aware short-circuit
---------------------------

When the user picks ``approve_for_session``, the runtime caches the
tuple ``(tool_name, params_fingerprint)`` under the originating
session id. Subsequent identical calls on the same session skip the
prompt and return ``approve_for_session`` immediately. The cache is
in-memory, never persisted, and never auto-evicted in 0.2 — session
lifecycle is owned by the adapter and a proper ``SessionContext``
cleanup hook lands later (tracked alongside the session scope work).

Deadlock avoidance (lesson #2)
-------------------------------

The dispatcher (and therefore this runtime's :meth:`request`) runs
**inside** the originating session's drain worker. The worker is
blocked on ``await pending_future``; a ``approval.response`` delivered
on the **same** session would land in the same worker queue behind
the blocked handler and deadlock until the 60s timeout fires.

To break the cycle, the runtime emits and subscribes on the reserved
``"kernel"`` session id. Approval requests go out on ``"kernel"``,
adapters forward the user's reply on ``"kernel"``, and the response
handler runs inside the kernel-session worker — a different worker
than the one waiting on the future. The original session worker then
wakes up, the tool runs (or is rejected), and the dispatch path
continues. The ``session_id`` field carried **inside** the payload
still identifies the tool call's origin for UI grouping; only the
event envelope's routing session changes.

Layering: no imports from ``cli``, ``plugins``, or ``core``.

Fingerprint params (non-JSON values)
------------------------------------

:func:`_fingerprint` calls ``json.dumps(..., default=str)`` so non-JSON
param values (``Path``, ``datetime``, pydantic ``HttpUrl``, ...) coerce
to ``repr``-ish strings rather than crashing. This is a **deliberate
fingerprint-stability choice**, not a security boundary: the fingerprint
keys an in-memory ``approve_for_session`` cache; collisions cause
extra approval prompts (safe) or skipped prompts within an already-
allowlisted session (which the user explicitly opted into for that
session). The cache is never persisted, never shared across sessions.

Single-event-loop invariant
---------------------------

All :class:`ApprovalRuntime` methods MUST be called from the asyncio
loop that installed the runtime. ``_pending`` is a plain ``dict`` of
loop-bound :class:`asyncio.Future` objects; cross-loop use corrupts
the bookkeeping and silently leaks futures. The kernel installs and
drives the runtime on a single loop — fixtures composing multiple
loops must install one runtime per loop (and uninstall on teardown).
